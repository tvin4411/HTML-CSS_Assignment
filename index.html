        <p>Weather is the state of the atmosphere—its temperature, humidity, wind, rainfall and so on—over hours to weeks. It is influenced by the oceans, land surfaces and ice sheets, which together with the atmosphere form what is called the ‘climate system’. Climate, in its broadest sense, is the statistical description of the state of the climate system.</p>
        <p>Climate change is a change in the statistical properties of the climate system that persists for several decades or longer—usually at least 30 years. These statistical properties include averages, variability and extremes. Climate change may be due to natural processes, such as changes in the Sun’s radiation, volcanoes or internal variability in the climate system, or due to human influences such as changes in the composition of the atmosphere or land use.</p>

        <p>Weather can be forecast with considerable skill up to about a week in advance. Short term fluctuations in climate, such as droughts, can be predicted with limited skill from season to season. In contrast, changes in the long-term statistics of the climate system (climate change) can be predicted if caused by long-term influences that are known or predictable.</p>
        <p>Energy from the Sun is the ultimate driver of climate on Earth. The solar energy received by Earth depends on how much the Sun emits and the distance between Earth and the Sun. Part of this sunlight is reflected directly back to space by the atmosphere, clouds, and land, ice and water surfaces. Aerosols (tiny particles in the atmosphere, some coming from human activities) can increase the reflection of sunlight.</p>
        <p>Human activities can also influence climate by changing concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, altering the concentrations of aerosols and altering the reflectivity of Earth’s surface by changing land cover.</p>
        <p>There are close connections between temperature, atmospheric water vapour, the extent of polar ice sheets and the concentrations of long-lived greenhouse gases (especially CO2) in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>When one of these is disturbed, the others react through ‘feedback’ processes that may amplify or dampen the original disturbance. These feedbacks occur on a wide range of time scales: those involving the atmosphere are typically rapid, while those involving deep oceans and ice sheets are slow and can cause delayed responses.</p>

        <h2>Impacts of Climate Change</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt id="3.1">Rising Sea Levels</dt>
           <dd>Climatically, coastal areas are exposed to sea-level fluctuations, coastal inundation and river flooding from short-term weather cycles and episodes of extreme events, even without climate change. This poses risks to households and settlements, businesses, infrastructure and essential services (water and energy) and industry such as fishing and tourism.</dd>
          <dt id="3.2">Rising Temperatures and Extreme Natural Disaters</dt>
            <dd>More than two thirds of Australia’s population are now living in a capital city. And over two thirds of Australia’s economic activity is generated in the capital cities. Climate change and natural disasters impact the location and design of our cities and the built environment, and the way we manage the natural resources that support human settlements. Climate change poses challenges to a range of publicly and privately-owned and managed assets.</dd>
          <dt id="3.3">Damage to Flora, Fauna and Natural Ecosystems</dt>
            <dd>Primary industries, such as agriculture, forestry and fisheries, are highly sensitive to weather extremes and variations in climate. Climate change presents new challenges in some locations and industries, while presenting new opportunities in others. Over the coming decades, projected climate change is likely to increase productivity risks for agriculture, forestry and fisheries in different ways.</dd>
            <dd>Scientists expect climate change to cause changes to the abundance and geographic range of many species, restrict or alter species movement and interfere with their lifecycles (such as the timing of germination). Climate change presents a biosecurity risk for Australia’s ecosystems by altering the distribution of pest and weed species.</dd>
          <dt id="3.4">Water Resources</dt>
            <dd>Australia’s rainfall varies greatly from one year to the next and from one decade to the next, and is strongly influenced by large scale phenomena such as El Niño and La Niña. Despite this large natural variability, underlying longer-term trends are evident in some regions, and these are likely to be climate change related.</dd>
          <dt id="3.5">Disaster Risk Management</dt>
            <dd>The increasing frequency and intensity of other extreme weather events poses risks to human health, including injuries, disease and death, and disruption to health services. For Example, drought has been linked to decreased mental health, particularly in rural communities.</dd>

            <p>"So far, the results have been positively chilling. When President Taft created Glacier National Park in 1910, it was home to an estimated 150 glaciers. Since then the number has decreased to fewer than 30, and most of those remaining have shrunk in area by two-thirds. Fagre predicts that within 30 years most if not all of the park's namesake glaciers will disappear."</p>

            <p>"Global warming boosted the risk of the hot, dry weather that's likely to cause bushfires by at least 30%, they say. But the study suggests the figure is likely to be much greater. Although it makes sense that human-induced global warming is likely to have led to more bushfires, assigning a figure to that increased risk is complex. That is because other factors not directly related to climate change may also play a significant role.
              These include increased water use making the land drier, urban heating effects or unknown local factors."</p>

            <p>"Although further epidemiological studies are needed, a significant amount of research has already demonstrated that climate change will affect animal health and welfare. Heat stress conditions as a result of global warming, high air temperatures, and higher frequency of extreme weather events and droughts may negatively affect animal health and welfare. Such effects may take place by direct and/or indirect mechanisms."</p>
